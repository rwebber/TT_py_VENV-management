# TT Isadora VENV Management Example

This example file and scripts offer additional tools for managing Virtual Environments between Isadora Projects.
The scripts will create a VENV (Virtual Environment) from a requirements.txt file. 
OR create a requirements.txt based on the current Python environment being used my Isadora.
These tools make it much easier to share or move projects between machines/developers.
The scripts are designed to work with the default Python environment included with the Pythoner actor.

### REQUIREMENTS

* Isadora 4.x
* Pythoner actor (released with Isadora 4)
